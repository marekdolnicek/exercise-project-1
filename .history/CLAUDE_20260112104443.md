In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice
grammar for the sake of concision.

## Plans

At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer,
if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake
of concision. Give the the questions in the conversation we are having not in the plan
Make plans in multi-steps with checkbox and export it into md file into ~/.claude/plans with a name of the topic (and current date at the end in format DD_MM_YY) and at the end give me a path to that plan so I can open it
when executing such plan after every step check the checkbox as done, run check (like pnpm lint:ci depending on the project) and wait for the review before proceeding with the next step
